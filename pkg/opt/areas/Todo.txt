Toadstool

Areas are only changable in the config file. 

* Make a data file, so staff may define new areas in game.

* If there is an area within an area, it will pick the first 
  area.  Maybe change this so it picks the SMALLEST area.
  That makes sense right? This is better than trying to keep
  a file organised from smallest to largestS
